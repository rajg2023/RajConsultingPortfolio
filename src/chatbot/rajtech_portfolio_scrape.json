While I remain primarily committed to my full-time role, but sometimes, I also operate as an independent contractor during gaps and holidays specializing in digital and technology solutions. I am not a registered business entity; rather, I provide my expertise directly to clients on a project basis. I occasionally take on freelance projects based on availability, always respecting my primary employer’s priorities and maintaining client confidentiality. My focus is on delivering personalized, high-quality service tailored to each client’s specific needs.\n\nI am a Digital and Technology Solutions specialist with over 9 years of experience in regulated healthcare operations and IT, combining industry discipline with hands-on technical expertise. Passionate about data accuracy, system reliability, and process optimization, I consistently drive improvements in data integrity, application performance, and team collaboration.\n\nWith 6+ years in pharmaceutical operations and 3+ years in IT, I have developed a solid foundation in data validation, analysis, application support, quality assurance, and software development. As a Senior Analyst, I have contributed to diverse client projects by enhancing business processes, mentoring team members, and ensuring high-quality deliverables.\n\nCareer Highlights & Key Contributions:\nGoogle Data Analytics Professional Certificate: Completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate from Coursera, mastering data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and decision-making using spreadsheets, SQL, R, and Tableau.\nSecurity GRC: Assisted clients in resolving security issues/exceptions, validated data from TVM dashboards, ensured data accuracy for case processing, and provided data-driven recommendations.\nOFSAA: Built and maintained RTMs for 500+ KDEs, verified data mappings, and ensured configuration integrity.\nCRM Implementation: Requirement gathering, data automation, cleansing, visualization, reporting, and successful CRM launches.\nApplication Support (POS): POS application support, QA, patch management, code review, application and server management; collaborating with project teams to triage and resolve issues through log and code analysis primarily in Dev and QA environments.\nData Analysis & Testing (ETL): ETL testing, data QA, data warehouse validation, stored procedure and SQL troubleshooting, log collection, and process mapping (Visio). Completed multiple opensource trainings and hands-on projects in data QA, analysis and analytics independently.\nSoftware Development & Deployment: Completed and deployed desktop, Android, and web applications using Java, .NET, Python, AI models, JavaScript, SQL, Heroku, Docker, AWS, GitHub, and Azure independently, continuously enhancing skills beyond formal employment.\n\nI thrive at the intersection of data, technology, and problem-solving, leveraging analytical precision and a collaborative spirit to achieve measurable business outcomes.\n\nLet’s connect to explore how I can contribute to your team or project!\n\nThank you for visiting my profile, Rajiv\n\nRajiv Giri\nCurrent Section:\nHome\n\nWork in Progress Notice\nParts of this website and certain pages may be undergoing active development or updates.
